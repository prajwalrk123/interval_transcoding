USAGE NOTES
Application uses recent libav* API, so consider using as recent version as possible.
Git master HEAD is usually ok. If stability is required, use libav.org 0.8 release branch.
Consider using libav.org, instead of ffmpeg.org product. Libav.org developers community is more helpful and responsible.
To make your libav* libs build right, build it using scripts/build_libav.sh.

To compile application, run
./bootstrap.sh # generate `configure` script
./configure # probably you want to use such options as --with-libav-{include,lib}-path
 # also, to use with ffmpeg.org libs, give --with-ffmpeg, otherwise libav.org libs are assumed
make
./interval_transcoding -i http://dl.dropbox.com/u/43104344/interval_transcoding.mp4 -o out.mov --encode_start 58 --v_bitrate 100000 --loglevel 6

DEVELOPMENT NOTES
Execute this when you add some command-line options
`gengetopt -i cmdline.ggo -a args -F cmdline`
